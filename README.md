# Sudoku Game - First Semester Programming Fundamentals Project

Welcome to the README file for my Sudoku game project, created as part of my first-semester programming fundamentals coursework. This project is developed using C++ and the SFML library. While it might not be the most optimized implementation, it represents my early steps in programming.

## Introduction

This Sudoku game is a project developed during my first semester as a part of the programming fundamentals course. It's built using C++ programming language and utilizes the SFML library for graphical user interface elements.

## Features

- Play Sudoku with a colorful interface.
- Save and load your progress in the game.
- Simple and intuitive interface, suitable for learning purposes.
- A basic implementation of a backtracking algorithm to generate and solve Sudoku puzzles.

## Usage

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game and use the mouse to navigate the grid.
2. Click on an empty cell to select it.
3. Use the number keys (1-9) to input a value into the selected cell.
4. If the input is valid and doesn't violate Sudoku rules, the number will be placed.
5. You can save the game at any point and load it later to continue.

Please note that this game might not have all the advanced features of commercial Sudoku apps, but it serves as a stepping stone in my programming journey.
